<p>Conway is a city in the U.S. state of Arkansas and the county seat of Faulkner County, 
    located in the state's most populous Metropolitan Statistical Area, Central Arkansas. 
    Although considered a suburb of Little Rock, Conway is unusual in that the majority of its 
    residents do not commute out of the city to work. The city also serves as a regional shopping, 
    educational, work, healthcare, sports, and cultural hub for Faulkner County and surrounding areas. 
    Conway's growth can be attributed to its jobs in technology and higher education; among its largest 
    employers being Acxiom, the University of Central Arkansas, Hendrix College, Insight Enterprises, 
    and many technology start-up companies. Conway is home to three post-secondary educational institutions, 
    earning it the nickname "The City of Colleges".
